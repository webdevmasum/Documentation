Note: Due to Graves data being initially input into your account, the rental percentage issue occurs only in your account. This issue will not affect other users' accounts. I will review the database and resolve the rental percentage issue in your account as soon as possible.

Please take some time to explore your website and let me know if you have any questions.

It's been a pleasure collaborating with you on this project. 

If everything looks great, please accept the job and spend a few minutes writing about your experience with the Fiverr community.

You have been a pleasure to work with, and I promise to do the same for you.

For some reason, if you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Have a great day!
