"Hello There,

I strongly believe that this message will find you awesome.

In this message, I want to share the project's current update that is as per our project requirement I'm working on a few features of the research area to explore them in detail.

For research I will need a few days which can be a maximum of 2 to 3 days, during this day maybe I will not have any visual updates to share with you. I'm trying my best to share a quick visual update with you that can make you more happy and more confident.

Till then hold tight and please stay tuned with me with patience.

I really appreciate your patience, your cooperation and support are highly appreciated.

Thanks for all.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or anything in your mind just ping me back, and I will get back to you ASAP.

Till then Take care.

Best Regards."
