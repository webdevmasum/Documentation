Hello Colin,

Thank you very much for taking the time to meet today. It was truly a productive and insightful discussion about your "Course Checklist". I appreciate the opportunity to collaborate and explore how we can bring your vision to life.

Let me give you some key points about the meeting regarding the main thing we discussed. Following items that we have discussed:

- I provided the course checklist design according to your project requirements, and we discussed it in detail. You really liked the design and even expressed your intention to give me a bonus, for which I sincerely thank you once again. 

- During the meeting, we decided I would deliver the project by March 30, and you will accept it.

- Additionally, I will provide support for one month per your project requirements in case any issues arise.

 As soon as the work is completed, I will update you promptly. If any additional points come up during the process, I will reach out for clarification. 

For some reason, if you have anything in your mind please don't hesitate to reach out to me, I will get back to you ASAP. Till then take care of yourself.
