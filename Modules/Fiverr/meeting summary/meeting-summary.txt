"Thanks for your time and amazing meeting.

It was a really nice and productive meeting.

As per our meeting discussion, I will create a project quotation and I will send it to you ASAP.

Based on our discussion, I will work on your project with the following features we discussed during the meeting:
- I will Develop your website development

As already we discussed the whole project and I told you that I would create a perfect project quotation with Charges and a Timeline to develop the whole project.

It will take some time because I will do broad research about your project requirements and feature implementation that we have discussed during the meeting. I hope you can understand.

I'm so excited to work on your project.

I will get back to you very soon with the project quotation estimation.

Till then please hold tight with patience, I really appreciate your patience.

Thanks for your patience.

Best Regards."
