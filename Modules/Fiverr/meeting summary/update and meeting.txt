Hello Mathew,

I hope you and your family are safe and sound.

I am currently working on your project, developing some parts from the backend, as per your project requirements.

As per your order requirements, I have completed the following tasks:

- I've developed a home page hero section.
- I've developed advisory sections.
- I've developed a hero section.
- I've developed a bookkeeping page hero section.
- I've developed a tax planning page hero section.
- I've developed additional resources.

Please have a look at: [https://www.loom.com/share/c73ad1ccdbc1463fa892b509f184d273?sid=6386b772-98d2-4d81-b3f6-023fa3d8a162]

To complete your project in a functional and dynamic way, I need some clear clarifications. If you explain how you want the project to be functional, I believe I can develop it quickly. I hope we can move the project forward soon through a meeting.

I would like to schedule a meeting for tomorrow, and I will be available from 9:30 AM to 6:00 PM (GMT +6, Bangladesh Standard Time). Please let me know which time within this window works best for you, and I will be happy to accommodate.

Looking forward to your response.

Best wishes.
