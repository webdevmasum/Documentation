Project clearification meeting invitation

"Hello Lezic,

Hope this message finds you well while you are reading this message.

Thanks for keeping faith and trust in us.

I went through the project information in detail, and after reading your project requirements I felt we should arrange a quick call to dive into the deep of your requirements to align your mission and vision with us so that we can achieve our goal based on your requirements.

I'm confident that through open communication and collaboration, we can still achieve a positive outcome for this project.  

Please let me know your availability for a call to discuss this further and explore potential options. 

I'm always available for you but from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM (GMT +6 BD Time Standard) would be better for me, Let me know your best time to join the meeting. I'm so excited and curious to discuss this with you.

After getting a clear guideline, I would be able to start the project as soon as possible.

Your guideline is like a radar to guide me to reach our goal.

Your support, guidelines, and cooperation are highly appreciatable.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards.
