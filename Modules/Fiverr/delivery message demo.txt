Hello Colin,
I hope you and your family are safe and doing well!

As per your order requirement and message request, I've completed the following tasks:

- I have solved the Payment issue.

- I have solved the sidebar menu.

- I have solved the spelling issues.

- I have solved the design in the 'Privacy Policy and Terms Of Use' pages.

- I have solved the Co-n-ta-ct me-ss-ag-e send issue.

Please have a look at: [https://www.loom.com/share/8fe75725c27447d8908fd1d996316132?sid=164c694e-0422-462b-91f8-afef6a687115]

As I mentioned in our last meeting, I will resolve the complex issue alongside your ongoing order. The issue with your 'Forum' is a bit complex, but I will address it together with your running order. Therefore, I am delivering as per our discussion in the last meeting.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'll respond as soon as possible.

Best regards.
