Hello Mattberman,

I hope you and your family are safe and sound.

If you have an individual Apple developer account then I need full access to your developer account and need the m-a-il and password.  If you have an Organization account then you can add my m-ai--l to your team. 

And for the play console, you can give access to my m-ai-l. 

Please look at the documents:- 

We'll need hosting and domain to host your backend code on the server. At this moment the backend is hosted on the local server. For hosting and domains, you can go to namecheap.

For some reason, If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Best wishes.
