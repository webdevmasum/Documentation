- I've developed the REST API for the R-e-v-i-e-w module.
- I've developed a Profile settings.

I am pleased to inform you that I have almost completed the backend part of the project and I have been able to create the REST API successfully. I am currently preparing to connect the API with the front end within the coming days. I have also been providing periodic updates from my local server to keep you updated regarding the progress so far.

To proceed further and deploy the last deployment, please sh-a-re the hosting and domain cre-den-tia-ls. With that, I will be able to deploy the project directly onto your server. 

Looking forward to your response. 

Best wishes.
