Hello Colin,
I hope you and your family are safe and doing well!

In our last meeting, we discussed the changes to the Google Docs. I have been working on those changes and informed you that some complex parts will require additional time. I have been focusing on your changes so far, and as you know, it is not possible to work on both the other order and the Google Doc changes simultaneously. I was providing you with updates on the progress of the changes. Since the two orders are separate, please let me know how to resolve this if I am not given enough time.

You are working on a dynamic application and want to add new features. I need to think in new ways, integrate the backend logic, discuss with the UI/UX team, and in some cases, modify the old logic. Without adequate time, the project will not be up to standard. Therefore, I believe that to achieve better output, it would be appropriate for you to accept an extension. You have previously received better solutions by allocating time. I know you are very cooperative, so weâ€™ve come this far. Therefore, I would like to continue working collaboratively on the upcoming tasks.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'll respond as soon as possible.

Best regards.
