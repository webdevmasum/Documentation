Hello Colin,
I hope you and your family are safe and doing well!

I am working on the Google Doc that you and Morgan provided in the last order. I have also given you solutions to some issues. Some changes are a bit complex, so it may take some time. I am granting you a 15-day extension. It is my humble requestâ€”would you kindly accept the extension? Anyway, I will quickly resolve the simple issues and deliver the work. If there are major changes, you have another running order in progress. I will merge it with that and provide the solution.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'll respond as soon as possible.

Best regards.
