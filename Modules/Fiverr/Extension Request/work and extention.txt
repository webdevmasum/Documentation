Hello Colin,
I hope you and your family are safe and doing well!

As per your order requirement and message request, I've completed the following tasks:

- I've completed the creation and editing of the MyCourse, Section, Unit, and Lesson modules in my course system.

For your help, I have added a video explanation. 
Please watch video: https://app.usebubbles.com/cVMSoagxcuQAvViMxsFR5A/project-update

I have completed the backend part of the course creation module and have already updated you about it. As you know, the "MyCourse" module is a bit complex, and while developing the previous flow, I have been continuously facing and resolving various issues. The quiz section of the "MyCourse" module is still pending development. It will take me some time to complete that part. I hope you will kindly allow me the necessary time and support me throughout this process.

I am granting you a 10 -day extension. It is my humble requestâ€”would you kindly accept the extension? I will finish the work very soon and deliver it to you.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'll respond as soon as possible.

Best regards.
