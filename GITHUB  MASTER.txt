git branch
--------------------------------
1. git checkout -b masum

0.  After create branch :
	2.1: git push
	2.2: git push --set-upstream origin masum 
	(then it will set up git hub)
.....................................................................

1. git pull origin branch_name
2. git push origin branch_name
3. git merge branch_name
4. git checkout main

Example:
1. git checkout masum            # Switch to masum branch

2. git pull origin jb            # Pull changes from jb into masum

# Resolve conflicts if any, then:

3. git add .                     # Stage resolved changes

4. git commit -m "Merged jb into masum"  # Commit merge

5. git push origin masum         # Optional: Push masum branch (if needed)

6. git checkout main             # Switch to main branch

7. git push origin main          # Push main branch
