Hello Mick,

I hope you and your family are safe and sound.

As per your Project requirement, I have fixed the following tasks:
  
- I've developed Go-og-le login.
- I'm working on Apple login.

Note: Your app needs some cr-ede-nti-als for Apple login. If you provide those cr-ede-nti-als to me, I can complete the Apple login.

The required cr-ede-nti-als are: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ckb3dMKwnvb4zL-ovp-ZblWdsc4b45nDEMCqiNjOhRE/edit?usp=sharing

Note: For AI integration, please p-u-rc-ha-se the AI API key, which can be obtained from the OpenAI dashboard.
 
For some reason, if you have any questions, modifications, or concerns, please let me know. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Best wishes.
